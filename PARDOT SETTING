``````			(##) WHEN SYNC BEHAVIOR SET TO USE Pardot’s Value:--
					(*) If Pardot and Salesforce field values differ when synced, Pardot’s value overwrites the value in Salesforce.

					(*) If the field of rocord in salesforce and pardot differ then the value from most recelty updated(in sf or pardot) record will replace the corrosponding value  
						in salesforce or pardot.
					
					
						
						
`````` 			(##) The "Do Not Email" and "Opted Out" options on a prospect record suppress a prospect from receiving emails from Pardot. Different actions select these options.
					  
					  (*) Do Not Email is selected in a prospect’s record when the prospect:
						1. Has a hard bounce or five soft bounces.
						2. Is imported as opted out.
						3. Is opted out in Salesforce.
						4. Is manually opted out in Pardot.
						
				[[[[[ NOTE: The Do Not Email field doesn’t map to a Salesforce field by default. 
							However, when the Overwrite Prospect Opted Out field setting is enabled, opting out a prospect in either Salesforce or Pardot selects Do Not Email.  ]]]]
				
				
						(*) Prospect Opted Out is marked in a prospect’s record when the prospect:

							1. Clicks the unsubscribe link in a Pardot email or email preference page.
							2. Reports an email as spam.
							3. Is imported as opted out.
							4. Is manually opted out in Pardot.
							
				
						(*) When the Overwrite Prospect Opted Out field setting is enabled, keep these points in mind:

							Opting out a prospect in Salesforce or Pardot selects the Do Not Email field upon sync.
							If Do Not Email and Prospect Opted Out are selected, opting that prospect in from Salesforce or Pardot deselects Do Not Email upon sync, unless Hard Bounced is marked on the prospect record.
							If Do Not Email is selected, but Opted Out is not, syncing an opted-in prospect doesn’t deselect Do Not Email. 
							However, manually opting a prospect in from Pardot does deselect Do Not Email.
