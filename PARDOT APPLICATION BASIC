			(##)  Pardot navigation is divided into four main sections: Marketing, Prospects, Reports, and Admin.

					(**) IN MARKETING:--  here we can use automation tools to segment our prospects, and build email templates, 
											forms, landing pages, send emails, monitor your social platforms, and create marketing content.

				

					(*)  Prospects tab: is where we access records for the prospects in our account. 
										our Prospect List contains every prospect in your account. we can also group prospects into accounts under Prospect Accounts. 
										Under One-to-One Emails, we can send an individual email to a single prospect. 
										Finally, we can monitor your website’s page views and individual visits under Visitors.

					(*) Report:-- Use this tab to monitor the progress and health of your marketing efforts.


					(**)  Admin tab:. Here we'll control our field settings, 
									  create and sync custom objects, 
									  set up your email authentication protocols, 
									  import users and maintain your account security.



			(##)  Every Pardot account comes with 4 default USER ROLES: 
					1. Administrator 
					2. Marketing User (one of Pardot’s default user roles)
					3. Sales Manager
					4. and Sales User. 
					
				To create a new user   Admin > User Management > Users --->> Click + Add User(user email should be unique accross pardot user).
				
			(#)  we can choose different points of contact for each type of notification. 
			
			
			(##) We can CREARE CUSTOM FIELDS in pardot if we want extra informations then stadard also this "CUSTOM FIELDS" is very useful For example, you may have some fields in 
				 Sales Cloud that you want to also have in Pardot, and then sync the data between the two systems.
				 i.e create a custom field in patdot and map it to the corrosponding field in salesforce.
				 
				  To do this, you’d activate your Salesforce connector, and then create a custom field in Pardot for each Sales Cloud field you want to relate to each other. 
				  Custom fields are available across all our Pardot forms, automation and segmentation rules, and dynamic lists.
			
				EX1: TO CREATE CUSTOM FIELD AT PROSPECT LEVEL.
				
						Admin > Configure Fields > Prospect Fields ---- >>> Click + Add Custom Field----> ENTER NAME
						
			
			
			(****)	ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OF PARSOT IS IT CAN CONNECT EASILY TO ALL THE SOCIAL NETWORKING CHANNELS.
					
					EX1:
						Admin > Connectors, and click + Add Connector --->Social Posting Connectors ----> click Twitter.
